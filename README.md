# BayesianPrimer
This is a tutorial notebook on how you might approach a problem in Bayes statistics. \
The overarching question is "What is Phil's height". This is calculated using what we know about Bayes statistics and derive a median answer\

Our priors are the measurements we have collected, we then use what we know about Bayes inference and the functions that describe it to further the calculation.
