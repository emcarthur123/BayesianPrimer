# BayesianPrimer
This is a tutorial notbook on how you might approach a problem in frequentist statistics. \
Similar to the questinos "What is phils height" the question that the  notrbook attempted to answer is what is the mean of the sample.\
First it generates a random dataset with a random mean. Then we sample 10 values from the distribution and calculate a mean from that\
Then attempt to use the likelihood function.
